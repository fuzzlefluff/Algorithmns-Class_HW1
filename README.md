Q4: pickTrees (3 points)
You build homes out of wood and you need material from a nearby forest. However, you want to
avoid deforestation, so you decide for each tree you cut down, you'll leave its neighbors alone,
giving the forest time to recover. However, you still need as much wood as possible, so you
have to be careful about which trees you pick to cut down.
Write pickTrees, which takes in an array of N trees arr where arr[i] represents how much wood
you can harvest by cutting down tree i. It should return the max amount of wood you can
harvest while following the rule of skipping neighbors
